No need to spend weeks on paperwork or security compliance procedures. No more lost conversions because you don’t support a shopper’s favourite payment method or because they don’t feel safe. We made our products and API expansive, intuitive, and safe for merchants, customers and developers alike.

Mollie requires no minimum costs, no fixed contracts, no hidden costs. At Mollie you only pay for successful transactions. More about this pricing model can be found [here](https://www.mollie.com/en/pricing/). You can create an account [here](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/signup/5543454?lang=de).
